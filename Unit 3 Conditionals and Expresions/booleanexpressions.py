# Boolean Expresions
# kinda like a mathematical formula
# 14 + 10 = 24  Algebra uses arithmatic operators
# + - * / // ** %
# 5 > 10 = falseboolean Algebra uses comparison operators
# can only evaluate to true or false 
# < > >= <= == !=

print(14 + 10)      # Algebra
print(5 > 10)       # Boolean Algebra

x = 5               # Set x equal to 5, tell it to be
print( 5 == 5)      # == asks, are you equal to eachother
print(x == 5)       # get equals 5, ask a quaestion 

# This is the Perfect test question 
# What is the diference between = and == ?

print(4>=2)             # True
print(1993 == 1993)     # True
print(-99 <-99)         # False
print(10 != 10)         # False. != is Not equl too

#Boolean expresions quiz

print("Walrus" + "Walrus")  # WalrusWalrus
print("Walrus" == "Walrus") # True
